There was once an egg that lived alone in a house that sat in the middle of the woods. He had been living there for about 3 years when he finally started to become lonely, and longed for a companion. One day, a big shiny pan stumbled across the lonely eggs house as he wandered in the woods. Tired and thirsty the pan knocked on the door. Delighted by the surprise visitor the egg ran to get the door but alas he tripped.
The pan was really happy. He wanted a friend too, and now he got the egg. The pan put the egg inside him and they started to travel together. The egg and the pan lived a long, happy life together full of adventures and new discoveries. The end.
